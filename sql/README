THESE SQL FILES ARE TO BE USED ONLY IN THE EVENT OF A DATABASE
WIPE OR IF THE SQL FAILS TO GENERATE WHEN USING THE STORE
PLUGIN.

MOST FILES IN THE 'PATCHES' FOLDER ARE REQUIRED FOR
THE STORE TO WORK AS THEY ALTER THE BASE STRUCTURE OF
THE BATTLEGROUNDS TOKEN SYSTEM TABLES

THESE PATCH FILES WERE GENERATED USING NAVICAT. IF YOU EXPERIENCE
ISSUES APPLYING THE PATCHES PLEASE OPEN THE FILES WITH NOTEPAD AND
REMOVE THE COMMENTS DENOTED WITH '--' BEFORE THEIR LINES
